#+TITLE: Emacs and Ruby

* Intro
** Prerequisites
   First things first. I expect you to already be an emacs user. This
   is not an emacs tutorial. Second, the tools and code give in this
   book are only guaranteed to work on emacs 24 and higher. Lastly,
   this isn't a book on rails. This book will cover general ruby
   programming.
** Yukihiro Matsumoto
   Matz, the creator of ruby, is an emacs user.[fn:1] He mentioned in
   a talk that emacs had a enfluence over the design of ruby.[fn:2]
** What we are trying to achieve
* rvm.el
  We are going to assume you have rvm and MRI 2.0 installed.
** eshell
* ruby-mode
* Enhanced-Ruby-Mode
* rcodetools.el
  gem install rcodetools
** xmlfiter
* Testing
* Magit
  Although not part of ruby, magit is a great interface to git and is
  worth learning.
